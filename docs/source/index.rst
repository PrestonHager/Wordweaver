Wordweaver Documentation
========================

Wordweaver is your complete toolset for creating conlangs.
It includes many features from phonology to grammar to custom lexicons.
You can apply sound changes to your lexicon and see how your language evolves over time.
Create branching languages to see how they diverge, or document existing languages.
Wordweaver is your one-stop shop for all things conlanging.

If you're trying to install the application, please see the `Installation <installation>`_ page.
If you're looking for a guide on how to use the application, please see the `User Guide <user_guide>`_.

If you're looking to contribute to the project, please see the `Contributing <contributing>`_ page.
We need devlopers, designers, writers, and artists to help make Wordweaver the best it can be.
If you want to use the application's features in your own project, please see the `API Reference <api_reference>`_.
